## Description
- Our appâ€™s functionality is to take the guesswork out of movie night. Our goal is to pair a randomly selected movie with a movie snack based on user inputs.

## MVP 
- Audience: Anyone wishing to watch a movie while eating a snack best suited for the movie genre.
- Problem: Like a good wine pairing, movies should be paired with a good snack that enhances the experience.
- Solution: The user will select a movie genre / theme and other parameters, which will then generate a movie title and a paired food item to go with their movie.

## Technology
- Movies API - The Movie Database
- Foodies API - Yelp
- CSS Framework - Bulma IO
- JQuery
